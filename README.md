> This app leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities through OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model to generate structured and controlled vocabulary, specifically Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) and relevant tags, based on a given book summary. The primary purpose of this tool is to assist librarians and library managers in creating metadata and cataloging resources with precision and efficiency.

## Features:
- Generate Controlled Vocabulary: The app uses NLP to create standardized subject headings that conform to library management conventions, facilitating consistent cataloging practices.
- Tag Suggestions: Alongside subject headings, the app suggests relevant tags that can help categorize resources for easier retrieval and thematic exploration.
- Streamlined Metadata Management: By generating structured outputs, the app simplifies the process of adding books to library systems, reducing manual effort and potential errors.

## Further Applications:
The generated subject headings and tags can be analyzed further to support data-driven decision-making in library management:
- Collection Development: Librarians can review statistical trends in subject headings and tags to identify underrepresented topics or genres, guiding future acquisitions.
- Resource Utilization Analysis: By examining the frequency and relevance of specific subjects or tags, libraries can better understand user needs and adapt their services to meet demand.

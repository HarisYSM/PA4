> [!note]
> This app uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model to bridge the gap between ***natural language*** (the way we naturally describe things) and ***controlled language*** (standardized terms used in library management, such as Library of Congress Subject Headings). By turning book summaries into structured subject headings and tags, it helps libraries maintain clear and consistent organization of their collections.

## What It Does:
- Creates Subject Headings: The app suggests official subject headings that follow library standards, useful for cataloging books.
- Suggests Tags: It also generates tags that can help group books into categories or themes for easier searching.
- Simplifies Cataloging: By generating these automatically, it saves time and ensures consistency when adding books to the library database.

## What Can Be Contributed For?
The outputs of this app can help libraries in multiple ways:
- Better Book Purchases: Libraries can look at the subject headings and tags over time to figure out what topics are popular or missing, helping them decide what to buy.
- Understand User Needs: By tracking which topics appear most often, libraries can focus on what users are looking for.

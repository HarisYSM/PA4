> [!note]
> This app uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model to bridge the gap between ***natural language*** (the way we naturally describe things) and ***controlled language*** (standardized terms used in library management, such as Library of Congress Subject Headings). By turning book summaries into structured subject headings and tags, it helps libraries maintain clear and consistent organization of their collections.

## What It Does:
- **Creates Subject Headings**: The app suggests official subject headings that follow library standards, useful for cataloging books.
- **Suggests Tags**: It also generates tags that can help group books into categories or themes for easier searching.
- **Simplifies Cataloging**: By generating these automatically, it saves time and ensures consistency when adding books to the library database.
- **Confidence Rate**: The app provides a confidence score for each tag and subject heading, indicating how relevant it is to the book summary. This helps users understand the certainty of the generated results and prioritize more relevant headings or tags.
- **Word Count**: It also tracks the word count of the provided book summary, giving an idea of the summary's length and helping to manage inputs for better results.

***note*** : *The confidence scores may vary slightly when results are regenerated. This is normal due to the probabilistic nature of the system and does not necessarily indicate a change in the underlying accuracy or reliability of the predictions.*

## What Can Be Contributed For?
The outputs of this app can help libraries in multiple ways:
- **Better Book Purchases**: Libraries can look at the subject headings and tags over time to figure out what topics are popular or missing, helping them decide what to buy.
- **Understand User Needs**: By tracking which topics appear most often, libraries can focus on what users are looking for.
- **Improved Cataloging**: With the confidence rate and accurate subject headings, libraries can ensure better classification and find resources more effectively.
